# Netlify Platform

### pros
- The setup was pretty straight forward.

- The Admin panel was nice, thought wasn't super clear how to get to

- The build limit of 100 would probably be fine for most Devs who want a personal blog type site.

- You do have a FQDN Site after setup is complete.
- It's nice that there's a form submission add-on feature.
- It's nice that there's authentication add-on feature.

- Was actually super easy to setup a static site for a demo site within a utility lib. i.e where the build exists at `projectRoot/example` and the dist folder is compiled at `projectroot/example/dist`. The relative build/path settings were clearly documented and actually I was able to get it correct the first time.

- There's a free tier.

### cons

Actually I don't find many cons with Netlify. Having done 3 sites now, each one was super smooth. Event though they were different.  The on down side is that there's not a DB feature with PASS services like Heroku, but it's not trying to either.
