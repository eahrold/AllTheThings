- It's nice that there's a form submission add-on feature.
- It's nice that there's authentication add-on feature.

- Was actually super easy to setup a static site for a demo site within a utility lib. i.e where the build exists at `projectRoot/example` and the dist folder is compiled at `projectroot/example/dist`. The relative build/path settings were clearly documented and actually I was able to get it correct the first time.

- There's a free tier.
