# 11ty

### Pros

- Super quick to get up and running
- Plugin system seems to work pretty well
- Enough users out there to get you started

### Cons

- The documentation is a bit disorganized.

  - had to do some digging to get to the info about including CSS

- the cli didn't error out, so initially I was having a hard to telling why my plugin settings weren't applying. Turned out they were in the wrong directory.


- As far as needing to know a "Framework", you don't but the moment you want to do something a little bit unique you're bringing something else in. Plus, in all honesty there's enough `.njk` templating going on that I'm not sure it's really much better than doing a site by hand.

- the `eleventy-netlify-boilerplate` provides nice guidelines, but is not trivial.

- The more I used it the more annoyed I got with just how fragile the syntax is, and how poor the error messaging is. There were a number of moments where the whole thing just stopped compiling for me and I have no idea why.

```bash
$ npx @11ty/eleventy --config=some_incorrect_config.js
```

- Something that should be simple and well documented, creating a paginated list from files in a directory for navigation, is actually fairly convoluted, and poorly documented.

### All in All

It's fine. As a technical user, I had a pretty good idea of where to start, and keywords to use when searching for what to do.

A non-technical user could probably set up a site pretty quick.
But I have a sneaking suspicion, that if they needed to do anything advanced they would get overwhelmed pretty quick.
